# A more fluid way of moving windows with BSPWM, which is meant to be
# implemented in SXHKD.  If there is a window in the given direction,
# swap places with it.  Else if there is a receptacle move to it
# ("consume" its place).  Otherwise create a receptacle in the given
# direction by splitting the entire viewport (circumvents the tiling
# scheme while respecting the current split ratio configuration).  In
# the latter scenario, inputting the direction twice will thus move the
# focused window out of its current layout and into the receptacle.
